# b1gMail Basic Authentification
This is a Plugin to provide Basic Authentification for b1gMail. It returns 200, when login is successful, otherwise it return 401 Unauthorized. I created that for the Authentification with Nextcloud.

More information about Integration with Nextcloud: https://github.com/nextcloud/user_external#basicauth

## Installation
Just put basicauth.php to the folder b1gmail root/interface. Thats all.
