# Classic Mobile Style

This plugin adds the classic mobile style which was included in b1gMail 7.0 until 7.2. It includes also the changes from https://my.b1gmail.com/details/79/

The classic style is very simple and optimized for speed. This plugin will only work in b1gMail 7.4 or later. If you have an older version, use this commit https://github.com/Sebijk/b1gMail7-Plugins/tree/a50ae6ceff375ce778651daed23a41e33b6ab0ef/m_classic.
